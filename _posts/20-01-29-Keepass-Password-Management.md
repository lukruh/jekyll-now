title: Manage and Sync Passwords easy, flexible and secure
---

intro, looking for a way to 
* sync pw between devices (diff platforms)
* keep pw at your own (no third party access)
* no plain text files (only crypted)
* flexible (keyfiles, custom fields, ssh)

Bonus would be
* accessable from web (from an unconfigured device)
* possible to import/export in common file formats
* organize (groups/tags)
* software integration (autofill forms, autoconnect ssh/vpn)

## Approaches
* OS Keyring (Unix/Mac)
* Store/Sync via Browser
* crypted text file in cloud

## Result
* KeePassXC + Cloud
Bonus
* NextcloudExt (web access)
* BrowserExt autofill login (even keylog protected)
* simple import/export/backup/(re)move (stored in a small crypted file)
