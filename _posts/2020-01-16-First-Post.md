Coming back with an idea, which is years old, but never realized. Making some of my notes public by simply pushing them to a gh-pages repository. Let's see how far this goes.. 

```python
# First of all I have to test the code blocks
input("why?")
def answer():
    print("because I'm going to use them a lot")
```
